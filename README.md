👋 Hi, I’m @Szymon-Kasprzycki
👀 I’m interested in web-programming, I am trying to find my niche.
🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, but now I have small stop to learn python to my secondary school certificate. After that I would like to learn React.js. I think I'm going to be as someone like fullstack web developer.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python projects or creating websites using hmtl, css, javascript
